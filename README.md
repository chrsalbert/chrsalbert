# Moin, hello, guten Tag!

I'm Christian, a Fronend-Developer and UI-Designer hybrid based in Cologne, Germany. After I returned from my world travel in March 2020 due to the global pandemic I've created some fun projects to learn a few new things.

Here are some of my recent projects:

I'll publish the code of my projects soon. But until then, I need to make sure I didn't push any sensitive data in the initial commits. Note to myself: Clean commits from the beginning! ;-)

(*) Please be patient while loading the page. Due to the free version of Heroku, the dynos have to be started first when they are inactive for a longer time.
